CS-303 Assignment 2

Mohammadreza Akbari Lor

For the first part of the assignment in folder ‘1’, as the images show, there is a menu that serves as a way for the user to interact with a single link list as it is defined in the program.

Note that the program and class was not written in a way that handles all errors. For example if the programs asks for an index in the list, it is advised to not enter a string or a negative integer. Otherwise the class works perfectly as was described in the assignment.

The data type in the class is defined to be as general as possible but in the main function for the presentation purposes the data type in the list is chosen to be string.

Also of note is that Boolean values are represented as numbers 0 and 1.

For the second part of the assignment in folder ‘2’, same as the first part we have a menu that serves to showcase the functionality of the classes and the same concerns with correct inputs are also here. But first here we must enter information of a professional and a non-professional employee.

No functionality was defined for the classes besides a constructor and the three functions described in the assignment.

The rest is self explanatory as the images show.
